# Image-Feature-Detection-and-Matching

Feature detection and matching is an important task in many computer vision applications, such as structure-from-motion, image retrieval, object detection, and more.

# Application Of Feature Detection And Matching
- Automate object tracking
- Point matching for computing disparity
- Stereo calibration(Estimation of the fundamental matrix)
- Motion-based segmentation
- Recognition
- 3D object reconstruction
- Robot navigation
- Image retrieval and indexing

# Feature
A feature is a piece of information which is relevant for solving the computational task related to a certain application. Features may be specific structures in the image such as points, edges or objects. Features may also be the result of a general neighborhood operation or feature detection applied to the image. The features can be classified into two main categories:
The features that are in specific locations of the images, such as mountain peaks, building corners, doorways, or interestingly shaped patches of snow. These kinds of localized features are often called keypoint features (or even corners) and are often described by the appearance of patches of pixels surrounding the point location.
The features that can be matched based on their orientation and local appearance (edge profiles) are called edges and they can also be good indicators of object boundaries and occlusion events in the image sequence.

# Main Component Of Feature Detection And Matching
- Detection: Identify the Interest Point
- Description: The local appearance around each feature point is described in some way that is (ideally) invariant under changes in illumination, translation, scale, and in-plane rotation. We typically end up with a descriptor vector for each feature point.
- Matching: Descriptors are compared across the images, to identify similar features. For two images we may get a set of pairs (Xi, Yi) â†” (Xi`, Yi`), where (Xi, Yi) is a feature in one image and (Xi`, Yi`) its matching feature in the other image.

# Interest Point
Interest point or Feature Point is the point which is expressive in texture. Interest point is the point at which the direction of the boundary of the object changes abruptly or intersection point between two or more edge segments.
